# Master's Course Project Portfolio  
This repository contains selected project reports from my Master's studies in Language Technology and Artificial Intelligence at Uppsala University. These works reflect my academic training and research interests in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, cross-lingual parsing, and syntactic generalization.

Each report addresses a unique challenge in the field, blending theoretical insight with hands-on experimentation using modern tools and models.

## 📄 Included Projects

### 1. **Survey on Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks**
An in-depth literature review covering foundational and advanced techniques in sequence generation using RNNs, with a focus on text modeling, language generation, and training stability.

- **Focus**: RNN architectures, sequence modeling, evaluation metrics
- **Type**: Survey report  
- **Tools**: N/A (theoretical)

---

### 2. **Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing for Faroese with UUParser**
A practical project exploring the performance of cross-lingual dependency parsers applied to low-resource languages. We evaluated UUparser’s effectiveness using transfer learning techniques for Faroese.

- **Focus**: Cross-lingual parsing, low-resource language NLP
- **Type**: Experimental study
- **Tools**: UUparser, Universal Dependencies

### 3. **Power Identification in Parliamentary Debates**
This project investigates the detection of speaker power in political discourse using linguistic features and classification models, with a focus on Estonian and Finnish parliamentary data.

- **Focus**: Discourse analysis, feature engineering, classification
- **Type**: Applied NLP project
- **Tools**: scikit-learn, TF-IDF, GloVe, DistilBERT

---

### 4. **Syntactic Generalization Under Constraints: Compact Transformer Models and Limited Linguistic Input**
A research project inspired by the "poverty of the stimulus" in human language learning. We tested compact transformer models trained on limited input data to evaluate their ability to generalize syntactic patterns.

- **Focus**: Language model evaluation, syntactic competence, generalization
- **Type**: Experimental research
- **Tools**: DistilBERT, synthetic corpora, BLiMP, PyTorch
