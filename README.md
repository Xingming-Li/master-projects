# Master's Course Project Portfolio  
This repository contains selected project reports from my Master's studies in Language Technology at Uppsala University. These works reflect my academic background and research interests in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, cross-lingual NLP, and human-machine comparison and collaboration.

Each report addresses a unique challenge in the field, blending theoretical insight with hands-on experimentation using modern tools and models.

## 📄 Included Projects

### 1. **Survey on Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks**
An in-depth literature review covering foundational and advanced techniques in sequence generation using RNNs, with a focus on handwriting synthesis.

- **Focus**: RNN architectures, sequence generation, VAEs
- **Type**: Survey report  
- **Tools**: N/A (theoretical)

---

### 2. **Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing for Faroese with UUParser**
A practical project exploring the performance of a cross-lingual dependency parser (UUParser) applied to a low-resource language (Faroese). UUParser’s effectiveness with transfer learning techniques for Faroese on various training datasets is evaluated.

- **Focus**: Cross-lingual parsing, low-resource language NLP
- **Type**: Experimental study
- **Tools**: UUParser, Universal Dependencies

### 3. **Syntactic Generalization Under Constraints: Compact Transformer Models and Limited Linguistic Input**
A research project inspired by the "poverty of the stimulus" in human language learning. Compact transformer models trained on limited input data are evaluated to demonstrate their ability to generalize syntactic patterns.

- **Focus**: Language model evaluation, syntactic competence, generalization
- **Type**: Experimental research
- **Tools**: LTGBERT, BLiMP, PyTorch
